# Welcome to the Citywide Wildfire Evacuation Time Estimation Tool

Our **mission** is to help communities respond to wildfires by providing resources for planning and mitigation.

## Motivation

#### Camp Fire in Paradise, California, 2018
In November of 2018, the [town of Paradise California was consumed by the Camp Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)#Timeline).

  </p>
Since then the [frequency and intensity of wildfires has increased in the United States](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/climate-change-and-wildfires). To help decision makers across the US make informed decisions about evacuations during wildfires, we have created tools that:
  - estimate the time needed to evacuate a city
  - determine the connectivity of roadways within cities
  - determine the resilience of roadway networks when areas are congested or occluded by obstacles
  
## Services
The interface for these tools is provided by [Unfolded](https://www.unfolded.ai/).

## Research
Currently, research efforts are focused on estimating roadway capacities during wildfire evacuations.
